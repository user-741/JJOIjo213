<h2>Session 5-1: Ethics, Ethical Principles and Computer Ethics-I</h2>
<div class="slide-content">
<h3>Why ethics for organisations?</h3><ul><li>A basis for values and visions</li><li>To motivate employees</li><li>Perhaps demanded by customers</li><li>For good relationships to stakeholders</li><li>An overall check on plans</li><li>To avoid various exposures and risks</li><li>Part of governance</li><li>Sustainability</li></ul>
<h3>Why ethics II</h3><ul><li>The finance crisis</li><li>A number of crimes, near-crimes and transgressions</li><li>Managerialism (Robert Locke)</li><li>Management not contributing to organisation growth/health</li><li>Not contributing to society</li><li>Money only management</li><li>Â«Greed is goodÂ»</li><li>Short term and limited plans</li></ul>
<div class="quote"><p>Greed is good. Embrace it. Love it. Live it. In fact, greed may be the one thing that can save us. Don't believe me? Greed was the foundation for this country. The brave souls who risked their life to settle in a new country did so out of self interest. Our forefathers recognized the importance of self-interest in the Declaration of Independence where they emphasized our unalienable right to pursue happiness.</p><p>- Robert Pagliarini blog, Moneywatch 2010</p></div>
<h3>Why ethics III</h3><ul><li>Self-interest is pervasive economic idea</li><li>Not supported by research, as overriding paradigm</li><li>Country differences, in Japan a negative personality trait</li><li>Other personal goals, sometimes more important:<ul><li>Family and friends</li><li>Personal development (e.g. Maslow)</li><li>Aestetics, a nice place to live</li><li>Contribution to society</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3>Relevance of ethics to ICT</h3><ul><li>Do good work (Aristotle)</li><li>Plan holistically (systems theory)</li><li>Consider end use (Aristotle)</li><li>Evaluate both ends and means (Kant)</li><li>Be stakeholder oriented (ISO 26000)</li><li>Take care of the environment (ISO 26000)</li><li>Contribute to knowledge</li></ul>
<h3>Definition Ethics</h3><ul><li>Moral philosophy.</li><li>Determining rights and wrongs, selecting actions to achieve good results, evaluating motives.</li><li>(attempting to summarise several definitions)</li><li>The achievement of wisdom, choosing actions that are benefical and acceptable long term; or sustainable. This implies a society focus.</li></ul>
<h3>Definition Morals</h3><ul><li>Beliefs and behaviour of group. The group can be:<ul><li>Nation, or geographical area</li><li>Group of nations</li><li>Religious or life view groups, and subgroups</li><li>Profession or similar</li><li>Other organisation, e.g. sports, clan, NGO...</li></ul></li><li>In an international organisation there can be many morals.</li></ul>
<h3>Forms of ethics</h3><ol><li>Metaethics (what is good? etc)</li><li>Normative ethics (what should we do?)</li><li>Applied ethics (how do we apply ethics to work and lives?)</li><li>Moral psychology (the biological and psychological bases)</li><li>Descriptive ethics (what morals people follow)</li></ol>

<h3>Codes of ethics</h3><p>Applying ethics to a profession or discipline, examples:</p><ul><li>ICT</li><li>Engineering</li><li>Medicine</li><li>Law</li><li>Journalism</li><li>Psychology</li></ul>
<h3>The Challenger disaster</h3>
<h3>Symmetrical ethics â€“ the golden rule</h3><ul><li>Do to others what you want them to do to you.</li><li>If you demand from others, demand the same from yourself (perhaps more if you are a leader)</li><li>See yourself as the other (good even for design!)</li><li>Empathy</li></ul>
<h3>the Gold-in Rule:</h3><p>Do whatever is necessary to bring in the maximum gold, without getting caught</p><p>http://www.kevinmd.com/bloghttp://www.kevinmd.com/blog</p>
<h3>Assymetrical ethics</h3><ul><li>When one party has more resources, knowledge, power</li><li>Often in professions (engineering, nursing, law...)</li><li>Need to be careful (professional!)</li><li>Need to be considerate</li></ul>
<h3>Instrumental ethics</h3><ul><li>Ethics an instrument for achieving something else.</li><li>Not based on principles or conviction.</li><li>Â«GreenwashingÂ»</li><li>Philantrophy used as an Â«excuseÂ»</li></ul>
<h3>Principle based ethics</h3><ul><li>Based on principles like (from websites):<ul><li>We want to deliver first class design</li><li>We want to be best in our discipline</li><li>We will contribute to society</li><li>We consider ecological impact</li><li>We contribute to environmentalism</li></ul></li><li>Preferably followed by action</li></ul><p>Picture from www.bouvet.no, design for SjÃ¸mannskirken.</p>
<h3>Compliance ethics</h3><ul><li>Within existing laws, standards, guidelines, morals</li><li>May need a Â«compliance officerÂ» in large organisations</li><li>- e.g. what does it mean to Â«follow standardÂ»?</li><li>Ensures that organisation Â«does no wrongsÂ», but difficult</li></ul><p>The Ethics & Compliance Officer Association (ECOA) is a member-driven association exclusively for individuals responsible for their organization's ethics, compliance, and business conduct programs. The only organization of its kind, its members represent the largest group of ethics and compliance practitioners in the world. The ECOA is credited with formally "founding" the ethics and compliance field in 1991.</p><p>www.theecoa.org December 2010</p>
<h3>Positive ethics</h3><ul><li>Contributing positively to:<ul><li>Organisation</li><li>Profession</li><li>Society</li><li>Environment</li><li>and other stakeholders</li></ul></li><li>Normally cannot balance lack of compliance</li></ul><p>Positive ethics 2011:</p><p>We invite you to submit a a manuscript for the Special Issue of the Journal of Business Ethics on Positive Organizational (POE). This issue targets the Journal of Business Ethics view that ethics encompasses "all human action aimed at securing a good life." Towards this end, more research must be directed toward the best of human functioning, especially within the context of today's ethically challenged business environment and protracted economic downturn.</p><p>www.strategie-aims.com</p>
<h3>The moralist</h3><ul><li>My life view is superior</li><li>Other views are inferior</li><li>I have the answers</li><li>I need no other authority</li></ul>

<h3>General Comments on Ethics</h3><p>The world of ethics is gray Ethical conflict is characterized by Intense feelings Rapid development</p>
<h3>Computer Ethics: Standards of Conduct</h3><p>The Top Ten Rules of Computer Ethics Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people. Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness. Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid. Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation. Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that insure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.</p>
<h3>Netiquette - Network etiquette</h3><p>The conventions of politeness recognized on Usenet, in mailing lists and email. The most important rule of netiquette is "Think before you post". Re-read and edit your email carefully before you send. Check the spelling and grammar. When responding to a newsgroup posting, quote the minimum necessary to give some context to your reply and be careful to attribute the quote to the right person. Only send email to the necessary recipients. Email is permanent and can be saved forever!</p>
<h3>Computer Ethics: Academic Discipline</h3><h3>History of Computer Ethics as a Field of Study</h3><p>1940s-1950s â€“ Norbert Wiener (MIT) Notes the social/ethical implications of computer technology "...we were here in the presence of another social potentiality of unheard-of importance for good and for evil." (Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, pp. 27-28, 1948)</p>
<h3>History of Computer Ethics as a Field of Study</h3><p>1960s â€“ Donn Parker (SRI International) Unethical and illegal uses of computers 1968: Led Code of Professional Conduct for the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Adopted by ACM in 1973. 1970s â€“ Walter Maner (ODU) Coined "computer ethics"</p>
<h3>History of Computer Ethics as a Field of Study</h3><p>1980s â€“ Computer ethics becomes an academic discipline Public issues: Computer-enabled crime Disasters caused by computer failure Privacy invasion via databases Law suits over software ownership</p>
<h3>History of Computer Ethics as a Field of Study</h3><p>1990s â€“ Lots of research â€¦ Health â€“ HIPAA Wealth Opportunity Freedom Democracy Knowledge Privacy Security Notion of (computer) professional ethics Computer professional == "anyone involved in the design and development of computer artifacts" (Gotterbarn, 1991)</p>

<h2>Session 8: Cyberethics</h2>
<div class="slide-content">
<h3>Scenario I</h3><p>Consider the following question: If you could use a computer to steal enough money so that you and no other member of your family would every have to work again, and there was no chance that you would get caught, would you do it? If you answered yes, then why? If you answered no, then why not? If there were a chance of being caught, does that change your answer? If there were a good chance of being caught, does that change your answer?</p>
<h3>Cyberethics Defined</h3><p>Scenario 1 is just an example of a much larger field of study called Cyberethics Wikipedia defines Cyberthics as "the philosophic study of ethics pertaining to computers, encompassing user behavior and what computers are programmed to do, and how this affects individuals and society."</p>
<h3>Cyberethics Examples</h3><p>There are many examples that would fall under the heading of cyberethics but here are a few such questions: If it is on the internet, is it ok to copy it? If you find an open port into a machine, it it ok to explore that machine? Is it ok to post false information about another individual or group? What is the definition of pornography and should access to it be limited on the internet? Where is the line between satire and blasphemy and who gets to decide? Is it ok to create a program the purpose of which is to provide illicit access to other people's data? Is it acceptable to write a program that provides guidance to a nuclear device? Is it ok to hack if you are hacking for the "good guys?"</p>
<h3>ACM Code of Ethics</h3><p>These are not new questions. Many of these questions have been around since the beginning of mankind, they are simply now applied to the internet. For folks new to this discussion, a reasonable place to start is the ACM Code of Ethics. ACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery This is the parent professional organization for all of Information Technology (IT) For those that wish to be IT professionals, it is a good idea to know and follow the ACM Code of Ethics but it is not just for IT professionals</p>
<h3>ACM Code of Ethics</h3><p>The ACM Code of Ethics is divided into multiple sections including: General Moral Imperatives More Specific Professional Responsibilities Organizational Leadership Imperatives Compliance with the Code</p>
<h3>General Moral Imperatives</h3><p>As an ACM member I will â€¦ Contribute to society and human well-being Avoid harm to others Be honest and trustworthy Be fair and take action not to discriminate Honor property rights including copyrights and patents Give proper credit for intellectual property Respect the privacy of others Honor confidentiality</p>
<h3>More Specific Professional Responsibilities</h3><p>As an ACM computing professional I will â€¦ Strive to achieve the highest quality, effectiveness and dignity in both the process and products of professional work Acquire and maintain professional competence Know and respect existing laws pertaining to professional work Accept and provide appropriate professional review Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences Access computing and communication resources only when authorized to do so</p>
<h3>Organizational Leadership Imperatives</h3><p>As an ACM member and an organizational leader, I will â€¦ Articulate social responsibilities of members of an organizational unit and encourage full acceptance of those responsibilities Manage personnel and resources to design and build information systems that enhance the quality of working life Acknowledge and support proper and authorized uses of an organization's computing and communication resources Ensure that users and those who will be affected by a system have their needs clearly articulated during the assessment and design of requirements; later the system must be validated to meet requirements Articulate and support policies that protect the dignity of users and others affected by a computing system Create opportunities for members of the organization to learn the principles and limitations of computer systems</p>
<h3>Compliance with the Code</h3><p>As an ACM member I will â€¦ Uphold and promote the principles of this Code Treat violations of this code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM</p>
<h3>Scenario I</h3><p>Lets reconsider our first question: If you could use a computer to steal enough money so that you and no other member of your family would have to work ever again, and there was no chance that you would ever get caught, would you do it? If you answered yes, then why would you assume that no one would do this to you? If you answered yes, then why would you ever place your money in a bank, credit union, or other financial institution? â€¢ If you answered yes, then perhaps you should not be an IT Professional!!</p>
<h3>Responsibility</h3><p>In our discussion, we have returned often to the word Responsibility. Lets consider what this word means. Wiktionary defines responsibility as "the state of being responsible, accountable, or answerable" OR as "a duty, obligation, or liability for which someone is held accountable." For our purposes, lets consider four types of responsibility: Role Responsibility Causal Responsibility Blameworthy Liable</p>
<h3>Role Responsibility</h3><p>Role Responsibility describes a situation where a person is responsible simply because of the position or role that they occupy. Examples might include: A parent's responsibility for their child and the actions of that child A teacher's responsibility for their class room and the students in it A firefighter's responsibility to save lives and protect property A software developer's responsibility for the systems they develop/maintain</p>
<h3>Causal Responsibility</h3><p>Causal Responsibility describes a situation where a person has done something or failed to do something that has caused an event to occur. Keep in mind that there is no fault necessarily associated with causal responsibility. Examples might include: A batter hitting a baseball over the outfield fence into a car windshield The wind of a passing car blowing a piece of trash up into the air that gets stuck to the radiator of another car A store owner forgetting to turn out the lights when the store is closed causing people to think that store is open A web developer creating a back door into a system for maintenance that is eventually exploited in a hack</p>
<h3>Blameworthy</h3><p>Blameworthy describes a situation where a person has done something wrong or failed to do something right that has caused an event to occur. Unlike causal responsibility, there is fault associated with being blameworthy. Examples might include: A person intentionally throwing a baseball into a car windshield Failing to secure a load on a truck or trailer that comes loose and hits another car A restaurant employee forgetting to turn off the oven causing a fire A software developer intentionally creating a back door without the consent of the client for future malicious purposes</p>
<h3>Liable</h3><p>Liability describes a situation where a person is financially or criminally responsible for something. Keep in mind that it is possible to be liable without being blameworthy! Examples might include: A parent's financial responsibility for the window their child broke A drunk driver's responsibility for the injuries or deaths of others A company's responsibility for the failure of a project A software developer's for their code allowing the theft of millions of dollars</p>
<h3>Scenario II</h3><p>Consider the following question: Eventually, as you learn about computers, operating systems, the internet and cyber security, you may have the skills to attempt to penetrate other people's systems. Lets say that you successfully penetrate someone else's computer without permission but that you do not do anything malicious. Is this ethical or not? If you answered yes, then why? If you answered no, then why not? If there were a chance of being caught, does that change your answer? If the law makes this clearly illegal, does that change your answer?</p>
<h3>Scenario II (continued)</h3><p>Non-malicious hacking Some hackers attempt to make the case that as long as they do not do anything malicious, then they have not done anything wrong Some even argue that they are helping to discover flaws in security or operating systems However, doing so without permission is at best un-ethical and at most illegal</p>
<h3>Scenario III</h3><p>Consider the following question: Taken from the movies Ferris Bueller's Day Off and War Games, let's suppose that your school's computer system is not secure, that you have the ability to penetrate that system and change grades, attendance records, etc. Let's also suppose that you are .001 points away from graduating with a GPA that would qualify you for thousands of dollars in scholarships. It would only take changing one grade from a B to a B+ to qualify. Would you do it? If you answered yes, then why? If you answered no, then why not? If there were a chance of being caught, does that change your answer? If the law makes this clearly illegal, does that change your answer?</p>
<h3>Scenario III (continued)</h3><p>Hacking for "good" cause Some hackers attempt to make the case that as long as they are not hurting anyone and their motives are "good", then they have not done anything wrong However, they may be missing the fact that by cheating their way to scholarship eligibility, they may be taking money away from students that actually earned it This kind of hacking is absolutely illegal</p>
<h3>Scenario IV</h3><p>Consider the following question: You are working on a paper for a class and you find a very similar paper on the internet. You want to use significant parts of the paper in your paper but you are unsure how much is too much. What do you do? It is on the internet so it is fair game, copy it! Since you don't know how much is too much, don't use any of it? Use appropriate excerpts and quotes but with proper citation. They are only saying what you would have said anyway, so what is the harm in using it.</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>Copyright and Fair Use Lets get some basics out of the way: All creative works are covered by Copyright law from the moment they are created Copyrights can be registered with the federal government but do not have to be registered to be enforced as long as the authorship can be determined Plagiarism â€“ claiming someone else's work as your own â€“ is simply wrong â€“ period! There are exceptions to copyright and most of these are in the Doctrine of Fair Use</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>Fair Use The Doctrine of Fair Use provides limited exceptions to copyright: The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes The nature of the copyrighted work The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes This means two things: You can use work covered by copyright for nonprofit educational purposes, but You cannot deprive the copyright holder from the right to profit from the copyright This means, for example, that a professor may be able to share an excerpt from work but they cannot simply copy an entire textbook and given it to their students.</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>The nature of the copyrighted work While some may interpret this as referring to the subjective quality of a creative work, it actually refers primarily to the distinction between facts and expression. For example, the fact that the Normandy D-Day invasion took place on June 6, 1944 is a fact and is not covered by copyright. However, an expression of that fact such as the book, and the movie, "The Longest Day', is covered by copyright.</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole An example of this would be copying a particular chart, graph, or algorithm out of a book as opposed to copy the entire book. While there is no set limit on the number of characters, words, or pages that is safe to copy, the legal threshold falls back upon whether you may be depriving the copyright holder from the right to profit. Thus if you copy an entire magazine article and distribute it to your friends, you are most likely in violation. However, quoting a line or two with proper citation is likely acceptable.</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work This is the standard of do not deprive the copyright holder of the right to profit from their copyright. However, there are some exceptions even to this. For example, a movie critic may blast a movie causing a lot of people to not pay to see it. While this deprives the copyright holder, parody and critique are expressly allowed under copyright law.</p>
<h3>Scenario IV (continued)</h3><p>Fair Use Examples As reported in the 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights on the General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law here are some typical examples of "fair use" exceptions to copyright: "quotation of excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or comment; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work, for illustration or clarification of the author's observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work parodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in a news report; reproduction by a library of a portion of a work to replace part of a damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a work to illustrate a lesson; reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports; incidental and fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an event being reported."</p>

<h2>Session 8-1: Cyberethics</h2>
<div class="slide-content">
<h3>Cyberethics Defined</h3><p>Scenario 1 is just an example of a much larger field of study called Cyberethics Wikipedia defines Cyberthics as "the philosophic study of ethics pertaining to computers, encompassing user behavior and what computers are programmed to do, and how this affects individuals and society."</p>
<h3>Cyberethics Examples</h3><p>There are many examples that would fall under the heading of cyberethics but here are a few such questions: If it is on the internet, is it ok to copy it? If you find an open port into a machine, it it ok to explore that machine? Is it ok to post false information about another individual or group? What is the definition of pornography and should access to it be limited on the internet? Where is the line between satire and blasphemy and who gets to decide? Is it ok to create a program the purpose of which is to provide illicit access to other people's data? Is it acceptable to write a program that provides guidance to a nuclear device? Is it ok to hack if you are hacking for the "good guys?"</p>
<h3>ACM Code of Ethics</h3><p>These are not new questions. Many of these questions have been around since the beginning of mankind, they are simply now applied to the internet. For folks new to this discussion, a reasonable place to start is the ACM Code of Ethics. ACM stands for Association for Computing Machinery This is the parent professional organization for all of Information Technology (IT) For those that wish to be IT professionals, it is a good idea to know and follow the ACM Code of Ethics but it is not just for IT professionals</p>
<h3>ACM Code of Ethics</h3><p>The ACM Code of Ethics is divided into multiple sections including: General Moral Imperatives More Specific Professional Responsibilities Organizational Leadership Imperatives Compliance with the Code</p>
<h3>General Moral Imperatives</h3><p>As an ACM member I will â€¦ Contribute to society and human well-being Avoid harm to others Be honest and trustworthy Be fair and take action not to discriminate Honor property rights including copyrights and patents Give proper credit for intellectual property Respect the privacy of others Honor confidentiality</p>
<h3>More Specific Professional Responsibilities</h3><p>As an ACM computing professional I will â€¦ Strive to achieve the highest quality, effectiveness and dignity in both the process and products of professional work Acquire and maintain professional competence Know and respect existing laws pertaining to professional work Accept and provide appropriate professional review Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences Access computing and communication resources only when authorized to do so</p>
<h3>Organizational Leadership Imperatives</h3><p>As an ACM member and an organizational leader, I will â€¦ Articulate social responsibilities of members of an organizational unit and encourage full acceptance of those responsibilities Manage personnel and resources to design and build information systems that enhance the quality of working life Acknowledge and support proper and authorized uses of an organization's computing and communication resources Ensure that users and those who will be affected by a system have their needs clearly articulated during the assessment and design of requirements; later the system must be validated to meet requirements Articulate and support policies that protect the dignity of users and others affected by a computing system Create opportunities for members of the organization to learn the principles and limitations of computer systems</p>
<h3>Compliance with the Code</h3><p>As an ACM member I will â€¦ Uphold and promote the principles of this Code Treat violations of this code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM</p>
<h3>Responsibility</h3><p>In our discussion, we have returned often to the word Responsibility. Lets consider what this word means. Wiktionary defines responsibility as "the state of being responsible, accountable, or answerable" OR as "a duty, obligation, or liability for which someone is held accountable." For our purposes, lets consider four types of responsibility: Role Responsibility Causal Responsibility Blameworthy Liable</p>
<h3>Role Responsibility</h3><p>Role Responsibility describes a situation where a person is responsible simply because of the position or role that they occupy. Examples might include: A parent's responsibility for their child and the actions of that child A teacher's responsibility for their class room and the students in it A firefighter's responsibility to save lives and protect property A software developer's responsibility for the systems they develop/maintain</p>
<h3>Causal Responsibility</h3><p>Causal Responsibility describes a situation where a person has done something or failed to do something that has caused an event to occur. Keep in mind that there is no fault necessarily associated with causal responsibility. Examples might include: A batter hitting a baseball over the outfield fence into a car windshield The wind of a passing car blowing a piece of trash up into the air that gets stuck to the radiator of another car A store owner forgetting to turn out the lights when the store is closed causing people to think that store is open A web developer creating a back door into a system for maintenance that is eventually exploited in a hack</p>
<h3>Blameworthy</h3><p>Blameworthy describes a situation where a person has done something wrong or failed to do something right that has caused an event to occur. Unlike causal responsibility, there is fault associated with being blameworthy. Examples might include: A person intentionally throwing a baseball into a car windshield Failing to secure a load on a truck or trailer that comes loose and hits another car A restaurant employee forgetting to turn off the oven causing a fire A software developer intentionally creating a back door without the consent of the client for future malicious purposes</p>
<h3>Liable</h3><p>Liability describes a situation where a person is financially or criminally responsible for something. Keep in mind that it is possible to be liable without being blameworthy! Examples might include: A parent's financial responsibility for the window their child broke A drunk driver's responsibility for the injuries or deaths of others A company's responsibility for the failure of a project A software developer's for their code allowing the theft of millions of dollars</p>
